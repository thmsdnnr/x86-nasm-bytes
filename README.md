# x86-nasm-bytes üçø

Some byte (bite)-sized projects to learn x86 Assembly. In particular, using NASM. The goal is to use no libraries or convenient functions in order to learn more about architecture and have fun!

## Projects

### atoi-itoa
* [x] atoi/itoa number converter
    + has basic I/O routines and number conversion
    + [ ] needs signed integer handling w/ carry flag check
    + [ ] more robust bad input handling
